# HLT project

This is the project for the Human Language Technologies course, at the University of Pisa (a.y. 2022/2023). It consists in the comparison of different classifier models for a stance detection task in order to analyze different behaviour and similarities. The models compared are supervised models (Naive Bayes, SVM), and transformers from HuggingFace ([BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased), [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)). The models were compared on [IBM Debater - Claim Stance dataset](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml#Argument_Stance) with 2 stance categories (pro/con) on 55 topics.

# Project tour
The project is divided in the following folders:

1. `src` - contains all the notebooks used in experiments.
2. `data` - contains train/test datasets of IBM dataset.
3. `plots` - contains plots of the experiments.
4. `report.pdf` - the report of the project with additional information about it.
